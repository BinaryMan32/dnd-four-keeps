- [[Durst Hammerhand]] had a message for us
	- "come speak to us at the [[Dwarf Father's Mantle]]"
- We go to [[Dwarf Father's Mantle]]
- well-crafted but very industrial
- [[Grall Fendotter]] greets us
	- [[Luka Votsk]] hands her the note
- [[Torbin]] and [[Corbin]] come out to speak with us
	- ask us to help open trade routes with the [[Clan Silverhelm]]
	- [[Bolg Silverhelm]] fears encroaching of other humanoids
	- closed the gates
	- they have a scroll to deliver to attempt to convince him
- 12 days' travel from [[Bard's Gate]]
- road to village of [[Taverlan]]
- follow river to mountain path
- we ask for rations
- they bring out sausages, just sausages
- watch out for [[Gnoll]] or orcs
- we go visit [[Brelyar]]
- place looks much better organized
- we hear a bit of rustling
- ask about the underdark
- tells us about the "Fae's rest"
- Where did it come from? it's been there
- Tunnels are pretty stable
- Any spells to make fae's rest stronger so we can travel more quickly?
	- It's possible but I don't know of anything
- [[Larenkar]] lived under [[Bard's Gate]]
	- is a evil conjurer
	- wildly rich
	- long-lived
	- a few hundred years old
	- definitely still alive
	- was probably a more powerful wizard than [[Brelyar]]
		- but the way conjuration works these days...
- [[Brelyar]] tries to teach [[Bayden]] and [[Luka Votsk]] greater invisibility
- As we leave, a middle aged half elf whispers to us from the alley
	- [[Andregor]] is member of the [[Gray Cloak]]
	- says there's a hit out on Risu's / Lord Kyle's Boys
	- if we run across [[Liliana]], don't listen to anything she says
	- [ ] find the [[Forever Stone]]
	- turns us all invisible so we can get out of town
	- [[Andregor]] didn't seem concerned about casting a spell in town
- head out on the road
- long rest for the night
